# SFX Maker #

This is a simple Windows-based command-line sound effects (SFX) generator that I wrote a couple years back.

It is heavily inspired by [DrPetter's](http://www.drpetter.se/) [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html). I no longer recall how I stumbled upon this cool tool, but I was fascinated with its abilities and wanted to write something similar. Learning some audio generation and playback on Windows was fun, too.
